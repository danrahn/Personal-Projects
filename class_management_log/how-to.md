# How to use this program.

The first step is creating the Excel files for your classes/students. This is achieved through the program after you write your txt files. Your folder should contain text files and the executable file. It should look something like this.

Then start the Management Log program, go to File, and click 'Create Excel Files...' 
This will automatically create an Excel workbook for each class and a page for each student. Note: You will need to restart the program in order to access other classes.

## Documenting

Select the class from the drop down list, then select the student. Then select the infraction and consequence level. You may add specific notes or leave it blank. Once you click submit, the documentation will be automatically added to the excel file for that student.
