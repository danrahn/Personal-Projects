# Gene Expression

This program is designed to let users practice transcription and translation using a GUI. It allows the user to input their own DNA strands or generate random strands. Then the user can input an mRNA strand, tRNA strand, and amino acid sequence and check their answers. The user can also obtain the answers inside the program.

## Getting Started

There are two .py files you can simply copy and paste and run directly. The difference is the styling of the GUI with the _ttk.py_ containing a slightly different look. If you choose to use the _ttk.py_ file you will also need to have the Assets folder downloaded and placed in the directory that you are running the program from.  

There is also a pyc file and exe file that can be downloaded. If you plan to use the pyc file you must have python installed. There ae no additonal packages that need to be installed that do not already come with python 3.6.

### Prerequisites

This program is compatible with Windows and Mac. It has only been tested with Windows 10 and is not guaranteed to work with any previous versions.
