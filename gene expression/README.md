# Gene Expression

This program is designed to let users practice transcription and translation using a GUI. It allows the user to input their own DNA strands or generate random strands. Then the user can input an mRNA strand, tRNA strand, and amino acid sequence and check their answers. The user can also obtain the answers inside the program.

## Getting Started

An executable file is available for windows download. I will update an app for Mac soon. You can also run the source code direclty. Note that for both cases you will need to have the icon inside the working directory you are using. The icons are located in the assets folder. I recommend keeping it all in the sasme folder then sending a shortcut to the desktop for ease of access. You can also take the source code out and comment/delete out the set_icon function to run the code without downloading the images.

### Prerequisites

This program is compatible with Windows and Mac. It has only been tested with Windows 10 and is not guaranteed to work with any previous versions.
