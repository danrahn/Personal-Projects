# Gene Expression

This program is designed to let users practice transcription and translation using a GUI. It allows the user to input their own DNA strands or generate random strands. Then the user can input an mRNA strand, tRNA strand, and amino acid sequence and check their answers. The user can also obtain the answers inside the program.

## Getting Started

The .py is linked inside this directoy that you can simply copy and paste. I've also included a pyc file you can download and run. 

### Prerequisites

This program is only compatable with Windows. It has only been tested with Windows 10 and is not guaranteed to work with any previous versions.
