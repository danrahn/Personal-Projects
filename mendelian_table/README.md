# Dihybrid Cross Mendelian Table

A dihybrid cross table is a table of potential phenotyes from two parents with two different observed traits. This program is designed to allow the user to choose the genotypes of each allele of each parent and print the results. The program prints out a grid of the possible combinations as well as the ratio of each phenotype produced. 

## Getting Started

An executable file is available for windows download. I will update an app for Mac soon. You can also run the source code direclty. Note that for both cases you will need to have the icon inside the working directory you are using. The icons are located in the assets folder. I recommend keeping it all in the sasme folder then sending a shortcut to the desktop for ease of access. You can also take the source code out and comment/delete out the set_icon function to run the code without downloading the images.  

### Prerequisites

Windows, OX, or linux. Note: I have not tested the icon with linux yet. It has also only been tested on Windows 10. If you choose to run the source code directly you will need to have Python 3.x installed. It has not been tested on Python 2.
