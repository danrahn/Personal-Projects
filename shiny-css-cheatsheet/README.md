# Shiny-CSS Cheatsheet
## This is a "cheatsheet" to help you style your Shiny Applications.
### This cheatsheet will NOT teach you how to code CSS
### This cheatsheet will NOT teach you how to code R/Shiny

The idea of this repository is to quickly edit the styling of your Shiny applications. There are some guides online for learning to code for CSS and HTML, however, if you're not already familiar with it you may not want to learn something additional for your Shiny project. This guide will show you how you create a CSS file separate from your app.R file then import the CSS file to use as a theme for your app.R. This app will not cover every aspect of Shiny, but it will be a good enough guide to change the look of your program as well as leave you with an easy way to figure out how to style what's not shown here. 

[Here](https://github.com/thomaskellough/Personal-Projects/blob/master/shiny-css-cheatsheet/Getting-started.md) is the getting started guide. This will show you how to setup your css file and incorporate it into your app.R program.

[Here](https://github.com/thomaskellough/Personal-Projects/blob/master/shiny-css-cheatsheet/cheatsheet.md) is the cheatsheet. These are just a few examples of how you can quickly edit things inside your code. 

[Here](https://github.com/thomaskellough/Personal-Projects/tree/master/grades-analyzer) is a project I made using this technique.
